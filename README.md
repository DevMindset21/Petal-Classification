# Petal-Classification
In this competition we're classifying 104 types of flowers based on their images drawn from five different public datasets. Some classes are very narrow, containing only a particular sub-type of flower (e.g. pink primroses) while other classes contain many sub-types (e.g. wild roses).

The dataset contains imperfections - images of flowers in odd places, or as a backdrop to modern machinery.
The task is to build a classifier than can see past all that, to the flowers at the heart of the images and classfiy them into the categories accurately.
